# üöó Dual Mode Smart Car (Arduino + NodeMCU)

This project is a **Dual Mode Smart Car** built using **Arduino UNO** and **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**.  
It can operate in two modes ‚Äî **Automatic** and **Manual** ‚Äî combining robotics and IoT concepts.

## üîπ Project Overview

The car has two modes of operation:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Mode
- Uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect obstacles in front of the car.
- If an obstacle is detected within 30‚Äì50 cm, the car stops.
- The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor left and right to check for more free space.
- The car then turns in the direction with **more distance** and continues moving forward.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Mode
- In this mode, the car is controlled manually using a **mobile app**.
- The app sends movement commands via **Wi-Fi** to the **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**.
- NodeMCU communicates with Arduino through **serial communication**, and the car moves according to commands:
  - `F` ‚Üí Forward  
  - `B` ‚Üí Backward  
  - `L` ‚Üí Left  
  - `R` ‚Üí Right  
  - `S` ‚Üí Stop

## üß† Working Principle

1. **Automatic Mode:**  
   The Arduino continuously measures the distance using the ultrasonic sensor.  
   If the path is clear, the car moves forward.  
   If an obstacle is detected, it stops, checks left and right distances, and moves toward the direction with more space.

2. **Manual Mode:**  
   The mobile sends control commands through Wi-Fi.  
   NodeMCU forwards these to Arduino via serial communication.  
   Arduino controls the motor driver accordingly to move the car.
